Feature 2: Interactive Build Journey Timeline - Product Requirements Document

OVERVIEW:
Build an interactive 3D timeline visualization that displays Zimbabwe's complete 45-stage building process, enabling diaspora users to understand the construction journey from land preparation to occupancy certificate.

CORE OBJECTIVES:
- Provide visual representation of all building stages with interactive 3D timeline
- Display cost ranges, duration estimates, and permit requirements per stage
- Implement progressive disclosure (12 major stages for free, 45 detailed for premium)
- Support city-specific variations (Harare, Bulawayo, rural)
- Integrate with cost calculator and compliance systems

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Database Schema:
- Journey stages table with parent-child relationships for stage hierarchy
- Stage dependencies table for prerequisite tracking
- Support for premium vs free content filtering
- City-specific data variations in JSONB format
- Cost ranges (min/avg/max USD) and duration estimates per stage

Frontend Components:
- JourneyTimeline: Main container with 3D/2D view toggle
- Timeline3D: Three.js-based interactive 3D visualization
- StageCard: Individual stage representation components
- StageDetails: Detailed modal/sidebar for stage information
- CostRangeDisplay: Visual cost range indicators
- ProgressTracker: User journey progress tracking

3D Visualization Features:
