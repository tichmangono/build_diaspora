# Task ID: 10
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement comprehensive performance optimizations including lazy loading, image optimization, Three.js asset loading with progress indicators, and CDN caching strategies
# Details:
Optimize timeline performance:
- Implement lazy loading for stage details and images
- Add Three.js asset loading with progress indicators
- Optimize image assets with next/image and proper sizing
- Implement virtualization for large stage lists
- Add CDN caching for static stage data
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Implement service worker for offline caching
- Add preloading strategies for critical resources
- Optimize Three.js rendering performance
- Add performance monitoring and metrics

# Test Strategy:
Performance testing with Lighthouse, bundle size analysis, memory usage testing, loading time optimization, testing on slow networks and low-end devices
