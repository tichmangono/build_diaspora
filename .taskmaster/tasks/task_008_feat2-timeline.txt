# Task ID: 8
# Title: Stage Dependencies and Critical Path
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement visual representation of stage dependencies and critical path highlighting to show users the optimal sequence and identify potential bottlenecks in their building journey
# Details:
Create dependency visualization:
- Implement dependency graph calculation algorithm
- Add visual connecting lines between dependent stages
- Create critical path highlighting with different colors
- Add dependency type indicators (blocking, parallel, optional)
- Implement warnings for prerequisite stages not completed
- Create dependency legend and explanations
- Add interactive dependency exploration
- Implement smart stage ordering recommendations
- Create bottleneck identification and warnings

# Test Strategy:
Test dependency calculations, verify critical path accuracy, test various dependency scenarios, validate visual indicators, test performance with complex dependencies
