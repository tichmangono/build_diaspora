# Task ID: 2
# Title: Journey API Endpoints Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create RESTful API endpoints for journey stage data retrieval, user progress tracking, and dependency management with proper role-based filtering for free vs premium content
# Details:
Implement Next.js API routes:
- GET /api/journey/stages - Fetch all stages with role-based filtering (free users see 12 major stages, premium see all 45)
- GET /api/journey/stages/[id] - Detailed stage information with premium content gating
- POST /api/journey/progress - Track and update user progress through stages
- GET /api/journey/dependencies - Stage dependency graph for timeline visualization
- Add proper authentication middleware
- Implement caching strategies for static stage data
- Add input validation and error handling

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each endpoint, integration tests with database, test role-based content filtering, validate API response schemas, test error scenarios and edge cases
