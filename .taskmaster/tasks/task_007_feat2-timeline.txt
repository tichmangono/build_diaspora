# Task ID: 7
# Title: State Management with React Query
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive state management for journey data caching, selected stage state, user progress persistence, and real-time synchronization across components
# Details:
Set up React Query integration:
- Configure query client with proper caching strategies
- Create custom hooks: useJourneyStages, useStageDetails, useUserProgress
- Implement optimistic updates for user progress
- Add background refetching for real-time data
- Create mutation handlers for progress updates
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Add loading and error states management
- Create prefetching strategies for stage details
- Implement offline support with cache persistence

# Test Strategy:
Test data caching behavior, verify real-time updates, test offline functionality, validate error handling, performance testing with large datasets
