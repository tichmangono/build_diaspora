# Task ID: 4
# Title: Three.js 3D Timeline Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the interactive 3D timeline using Three.js with stage nodes positioned along a timeline curve, camera controls, zoom capabilities, and smooth animations between stages
# Details:
Create Timeline3D.tsx component:
- Set up Three.js scene, camera, and renderer with proper lighting
- Create timeline curve using spline geometry
- Position stage nodes along the curve with proper spacing
- Implement OrbitControls for camera manipulation
- Add interactive hover and click states for stage nodes
- Create smooth camera animations when navigating between stages
- Implement zoom functionality with constraints
- Add stage dependency visualization with connecting lines
- Handle responsive canvas sizing
- Implement WebGL capability detection with graceful fallback

# Test Strategy:
Test 3D scene initialization, verify stage node positioning, test camera controls and animations, performance testing with many stages, WebGL fallback testing
