# UX Design Patterns and Information Architecture

## Single Responsibility Principle for UI Components

### Tab Design
- Each tab should have **one clear, focused purpose**
- Avoid showing the same information across multiple tabs
- Apply contextual relevance - show information where it's most useful

### Information Architecture Strategy
- **Configure Tab**: Form inputs + contextual reference data
- **Progress Tab**: Real-time monitoring of active operations only
- **Results Tab**: Completed operations with action workflows
- **Details Pages**: Comprehensive view for individual items

## Redundancy Elimination

### Problem Identification
- Look for duplicate tables, lists, or data displays across tabs
- Identify information that appears in multiple contexts without clear purpose
- User feedback: "same information showing everywhere"

### Solution Approach
1. **Audit existing structure** - map what appears where
2. **Define clear purposes** - what is each tab/section for?
3. **Apply contextual placement** - where is this information most useful?
4. **Eliminate true redundancies** - remove unnecessary duplicates
5. **Maintain workflows** - ensure user tasks still flow naturally

## Progressive Disclosure
- Show information when and where users need it
- Use reference data contextually (e.g., recent items for comparison when configuring)
- Avoid overwhelming users with repeated information

## Cognitive Load Reduction
- Remove visual clutter from redundant components
- Focus user attention on the primary task of each interface section
- Use consistent patterns but avoid unnecessary repetition

## Implementation Guidelines
- Start with user observation and feedback
- Apply systematic analysis before making changes
- Verify that workflows remain intact after optimization
- Test that the interface feels cleaner and more focused
