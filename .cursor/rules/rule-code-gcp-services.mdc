GCP Services 
- Use Pub/Sub for real-time data streaming and event handling. 
- Use Firestore for low-latency asset/config data storage. 
- Deployt to Cloud Run, leveraging serverless auto-scaling. 
- Use Cloud Functions for lightweight serverless triggers or utility endpoints. 
- Integrate Cloud IAM for security and role-based access to services. 
- Implement comprehensive logging with Google Cloud Logging; use Google Cloud Monitoring for application insights. 
- Use Cloud Run with Docker Deployed through cloudyaml and github automations and secrets

Cloud Pub/Sub, Firestore, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions 
- Use small, focused Cloud Functions to handle Pub/Sub messages when real-time data is ingested. 
- Ensure Firestore security rules are strict, using IAM or Firebase Auth if needed. 
- In Next.js route handlers, connect to Firestore for reading/writing data. Employ caching or Pub/Sub triggers to keep data fresh. 
- Deploy Next.js to Cloud Run with minimal runtime overhead; use Docker or a recommended builder approach. 
- Use environment variables for keys and project IDs (e.g., process.env.GCP_PROJECT_ID).
